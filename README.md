# APS+ 
The Arras.io Private Server Template was originally made by Oblivion#3940 (aka z46-dev), then improved by Zenphia#5994, and now refined and optimized by damocles#0001 (https://github.com/SpanksMcYeet/)

***I am not taking requests for code edits. If you want to provide feedback, please do so in the suggestions channel in the discord server. The server isn't public yet but it soon will be.***

## Setting up your server

Once you've remixed the template, follow these steps:

In the server's `config.json`:
1. Find the `host` property.
2. Replace "`aps-template`" with your glitch project's name, it should be in the top-left corner above "Settings".

Then, give your new project a name. (Settings > Edit project details)

Your private server will be at <https://servername.glitch.me> (replace `servername` with its new name, it should be near the top-left corner)
